Description: This package simply re-packages the existing bencoding and bdecoding implemention from the 'official' BitTorrent client as a separate, leight-weight package for re-using them without having the entire BitTorrent software as a dependency.
        
        It currently uses the implementation from BitTorrent Version 5.0.8, the file `bencode.py` is a verbatim, unmodified copy from that distribution.
        
        It also contains some tests and a benchmark.
