Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Do you have smaller Python projects that only need a README file
        for documentation? Want to host your README on `Read The Docs`_?
        
        sphinx-me is a `BSD licensed`_ tool that will create a `Sphinx`_
        documentation shell for your project and include the README file
        as the documentation index. It handles extracting the required meta
        data such as the project name, author and version from your project
        for use in your Sphinx docs.
        
        Once you use sphinx-me to build your Sphinx docs, you can then
        add your project to the Read The Docs site and have your project's
        README hosted with an attractive Sphinx documentation theme.
        
        .. note::
        
            Your README file should be in a `reStructuredText`_ compatible
            format.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install sphinx-me is directly from `PyPI`_ using
        `pip`_ or `setuptools`_ by running the respective command below::
        
            $ pip install -U sphinx-me
        
        or::
        
            $ easy_install -U sphinx-me
        
        Otherwise you can download sphinx-me and install it directly
        from source::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Running
        =======
        
        sphinx-me will be installed as a system-wide script that can be run from
        the command line while in your project's root directory::
        
            $ sphinx-me
        
        When run in your project's directory, it will create a ``docs`` directory
        with two files, the Sphinx ``conf.py`` module, and an ``index.rst`` file
        which will include your project's README.
        
        The ``conf.py`` module calls a setup function from sphinx-me that sets up
        the minimum required settings for your Sphinx docs.
        
          * ``project`` - the directory name of your project is used.
          * ``version`` - retrieved from the ``version`` arg of your ``setup.py`` script, or your package's ``__version__`` attribute.
          * ``copyright`` - retrieved from the ``author`` arg of your ``setup.py`` script, or your package's ``__author__`` attribute.
